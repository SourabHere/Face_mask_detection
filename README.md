# About The Project

During the pandemic COVID-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised the use of masks as part of a comprehensive package of prevention and control 
measures to limit the spread of this virus.This project is focused on Real time face mask detection algorithm using machine learning with Python.

## Libraries used
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* OpenCV
* numpy

## Setup
To run this project, install the libraries locally using pip:
```
pip install tensorflow
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install opencv
```

## Summary of code
<h2>The project can be divided into three parts: </h2>
<p>1.Reshaping and Normalizing images in dataset. <br> 2.Creation and training of model using tensorflow.<br> 3.Using trained model in opencv to detect face-mask. </p>
